DatingApp-SPA - front end Angular project

I am working on this Udemy project of a Dating App which has an Angular front end and a C# back end. I used Visual Studio Code for both back end and front end adding extensions as I needed. I used DotNet Core for this Dating app. I have created the User model so that the user can Register and create usernames and passwords and store them in the database. Then they can log in and authenticate against the information in the database. The project is a large project and features I am currently working on adding Photo upload funcationality to the application, Likes functionality and a private messaging system.
